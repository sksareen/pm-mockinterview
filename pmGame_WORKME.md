- Select time for the answer (10/20/30/40 mins options)

Step 2: Answer
- Watch the timer countdown
- Answer via  selected input mechanism
- Submit answer before the time is complete. once the time is complete submit the answer prepared
Step 3: Review
- The submitted answer is reviewed and scored against the rubric
- Returns a score, and areas to improve
- Provides input for how to improve each section and the answer overall
- Option to try again or return to home for a new question

### Adjustments to the template

## Iteration 1
### What Worked
- UX is engaging and interactive, works for mobile too
- Questions are pulling correctly
- Toolbar exists
### What Didn't
- Clean up data, make it more than just Meta
- Rename TimeStamp to Year
- Check for answer if no text input
- rename 'try again' to 'same question'
- Toolbar should have a hover effect and then slide out when the mouse goes to the left 10px of the screen, stay hidden otherwise


## FUTURE
