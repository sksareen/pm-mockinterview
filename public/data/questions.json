Talked about Meta's mission and why this feature will make sense/motivation to build. Created high level Goal for this feature. Interviewer asked directly for metrics but i asked him if i can Identify User segments and user journey so it can help me to define metrics and he was ok and very friendly. Came up with key metrics and asked if he wants me to think in any other direction and interviewer pointed me to also think about negative scenarios for this product. Came up with couple more metrics. Interviewer asked me for a counter metric - I asked him i can define NSM and he was ok. I defined North star metric and then came up with counter metric. For Tradeoff question asked a lot of follow up question to make sure it is due to the launch of new product Bookmark only and there is no other experiment running or no changes to newsfeed and other metrics are not affected also metrics were stable before launch. Came up with hypothesis it is due to launch of new product only. But wanted to run A/.B test to confirm. Defined control and variant and created a test with metrics to measure.

IN that case, I think it's important to first diagnose what caused the drop in Marketplace messages before jumping into the trade off. If after, all the possible root causes eliminated and you are convinced that it is in fact caused by a new feature in Shops, then I would want to understand if the drop in messages is impacting the success of Marketplace, (again, for marketplace, your success metric is # of items sold). If the drop in messages is correlated with drop in # of items sold in Marketplace, then you are trading off items being sold in Marketplace with items being sold in Shops. With the introduction of Shops feature, it's reasonable to assume that people who used to sell in Marketplace are now opening shops in Shops. It would then make sense to look at the total of Marketplace and Shops items sold and make sure it's growing. So rather than looking at each, you're making sure the total is growing at a healthy rate.",

    "Question Type (e.g. Product, Strategy)": "Product Sense",
    "Comments (e.g. your approach)": "- Clarified on definition of hyperlocal - Defined it as a community of people in a 2-3 km radius and assumed geography as India\n- Talked about different type of community needs in a hyperlocal space - public services, local grocery delivery, food delivery, parcel delivery, making new friends for shared interests like playing badminton (Prioritised public services since it was underserved with respect to things like sewage cleaning, electricity outage in an area, community traffic problems, water logging in roads which are unique to India) \n- Then defined the high level goal (based on reframing the problem) - Connect people to things that matter most in their nearby community \n- Talked about user segments (working professionals, homemakers, students, old age/retired people) and picked one (busy working professionals) which is a good TAM and need for solving the problem\n- Talked about pain points of working professionals with respect to pubic services ( not sure who is the right person to contact , unsure if online public portals are helpful, uncertainty on promise from public servants, unable to plan things around public service disruption) \n- Solution - helping working professionals discover people who are facing similar problems in their community, connect over a virtual online event in facebook, get into a private virtual room with people who have expressed interest on solving this and get the collective thoughts into a plan for action like calling someone (or) putting an online petition etc. and finally share what worked what didn't work for the benefit of the larger public and finally helping the community to pin these thoughts (or) into a saved section of Q&A",

Before I reached the solutions point, I had 5 minutes left in the interview, and the interviewer reminded me the question is \"should FB build this product or not\". None of my preparation or training helped me answer this question because product sense is not supposed to be general product strategy interview. I didn't get the offer but the recruiter told me later on that I lacked structure in my interviews but did well with users and metrics etc.",
